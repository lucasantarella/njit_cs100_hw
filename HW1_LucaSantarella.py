Exercises:
    1.1: 
        `print("test"` or `print "test"` would yield a syntax error and would not run. In Python2, no parenthesis was 
        standard syntax as print was not a function call.
    1.2: 
        If one or both quotation marks are omitted a syntax error will occur. If there is another quotation mark further
        in the file, this may trigger the entire block to be counted as a string and all of the code will be part of the string.
